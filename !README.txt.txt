1_VGG_Modified_ModelCode.py
	This is the first CNN model architecture that was coded which is the VGG16 Inspired Model. This has differing layers in terms of the convolution and pooling ayers utilised. 

2_CNN_LSTM_ModelCode.py
	This is the second CNN model architecture that was coded which is the CNN-LSTM Model. There is an addition of the LSTM layer alongside the TimeDistributed which was added due to LSTM being temporal data. 

3_LeNet_ModelCode.py
	This is the third LeNet CNN model architecture that was coded which is the LeNet Modified Model. This was a smaller version and modified version of the CNN architectuer code. 


EvaluationMatrix_Code.py
	The code that was used to evaluate the .h5 model files. These include, the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. 

Graphing_Code.py
	This was used to graphically represent the models after saving the epoch data into the 'xx_ValAcc_Model' files. 


ImageClassification-Benign_Grayscale.py
	This helped to classify the datasets that were already split into their Benign classifications to train the CNN models. 

ImageClassification-Not_Benign_Grayscale.py
	This is the Not-Benign Image classifier to split the datasets into malicious image classifications. 

Splitting_Data.py
	Used to split the general dataset into the Train and Test data. The percentage used is the 80% Train and 20% Test
